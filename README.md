```

Sync your Supertokens roles and permissions to a local file. If you have many
apps that need to be in sync with what roles and permissions _actually_ exist in
your Supertokens core instance while you develop or as a safety check during
build, you can use `supertokens-sync` to maintain a central auth config file
that includes roles, permissions and roles with permissions.

The script will retrieve roles and permissions from both Supertokens development
and production cores, and perform a comparison. If there is a mismatch between
the cores in terms of roles and permissions, the script will prioritize one set
and generate a config file based on it (in the config you can select which to
prioritize).

Also retrieves and compares tenants, but only by ID.

## Prerequisites

Expected `.env` and `.env.production` populated with the required keys for
operation.

If you have a local `.prettierrc`, the script will pick it up and format the
output according it, otherwise prettier defaults will be used.

## Usage

-   Navigate to your project root.
-   Install with `npm i @solgt/supertokens-sync`.
-   Run with `npx supertokens-sync`.
-   ‚ö†Ô∏è First run will create a local `supertokens-sync-config.json` (and will
    likely need to be set up).
-   Make use of the generated auth config file. The `.ts` version also exports
    types.

From here you can put `npx supertokens-sync` in front of your development
command, during pre-build or just as an isolated command.

## Caveats

Keys generated out of roles and permissions are capitalized, and any characters
_not_ a letter or a number will be replaced with an underscore. For example: if
a permission is the string `"read:feature:lists"`, the generated key will be
`READ_FEATURE_LISTS`.

## Configuration

The configuration file `supertokens-sync-config.json` is automaticaly generated
with defaults when no config file is detected.
